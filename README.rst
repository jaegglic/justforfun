Just For Fun
============

Just a small project for playing around with packages such as:

- ``PyPDF2`` (reading PDF files)
- ``nltk``, ``spacy``, and ``textblob-de`` (NLP)
- ``sklearn``, ``keras``, and/or ``tensorflow`` (ML)

and others.

Please note that the raw PDF files ar not uploaded. Feel free to put your own
files into the folder ``data/raw`` and adapt the file names accordingly.
