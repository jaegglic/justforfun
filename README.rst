Just For Fun
============

Just a small project that aimed to prepare some funny plots that should help me (at that time)
during a job application. The code is playing around with packages such as:

- ``PyMuPDF`` and ``PyPDF2`` (reading PDF files)
- ``nltk``, ``spacy``, and ``textblob-de`` (Natural Language Processing)
- ``sklearn`` (Machine Learning).

Please note that the required PDF files ar not uploaded. Feel free to put your own
files into the folder ``data/raw`` and adapt the file names accordingly.
